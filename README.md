# PlanetDatabase
MVC 6 Sample Project

There are two projects in this solution. A web application and an Web api application.

Used an Empty MVC 6 project, used bower as the client side package manager and Nuget for the server side. I used a Web api project to retrieve a list of planets in our solar system
